# Improved_Library_Management_System
This was a final project of the ECE3310 course at Cal Poly Pomona. The program improves an original C source code into an improved C++ source code. My group and I added a way for students to leave a rating of a book that they have been issued. After they leave a rating, it will still be visible after they return the book, allowing other students to see all the reviews, so that other students can see all the reviews of that specific book. Another function we added is to allow the student to view pre-existing reviews of other books they haven’t checked out yet and show the students the average rating of the book.
